[Android SDK](https://github.com/sumup/sumup-android-sdk) 7.1.0 has been [released](https://github.com/sumup/sumup-android-sdk/releases/tag/v7.1.0).

**Added:**

- Support for target SDK 36.
- Support for Android Gradle Plugin 9.x.
- `SumUpLoginContract`, `SumUpCardReaderPageContract`, and `SumUpCheckoutContract` to support Activity Result API integrations. Existing onActivityResult-based integrations remain unchanged. Please refer to the documentation for more information.

**Improvements:**

- Reduced SDK size by approximately 8 MB.
- In offline sessions, totalApprovedAmount now includes tip amounts.

**Important:** SDK v7.1.0 introduces internal changes that are not backward compatible. After upgrading and running the application with v7.1.0, downgrading to an earlier SDK version is not supported.
